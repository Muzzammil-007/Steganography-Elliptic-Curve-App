The methodology for integrating Elliptic Curve Encryption (ECE) with Least Significant Bit (LSB) Steganography
involves a systematic approach to ensure the seamless fusion of these two techniques for hidden communication.
The process encompasses key generation, ECE encryption, and embedding the encrypted message within cover
media using LSB steganography.
